<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A delicious soup to use up the abundance of garden-fresh tomatoes we have each year. Fresh and flavorful, and many opportunities to adjust this soup to your liking!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>7 cups chopped fresh tomatoes (with seeds and juice)</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup finely chopped carrots</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon celery salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    <li>1 cup skim milk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons butter (Optional)</li>
    <li>5 large fresh basil leaves, or more to taste</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons shredded fresh basil, or to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine tomatoes, onion, carrots, and garlic in a large pot. Drizzle olive oil over tomato mixture; cook and stir over medium heat. Cover pot and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix chicken broth, salt, sugar, dill, black pepper, celery salt, and cloves into tomato mixture. Cover pot and simmer, stirring occasionally, until soup flavors have blended, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Whisk milk and cornstarch together in a bowl until dissolved.</li>
    <li>Heat butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk cornstarch mixture into melted butter until smooth and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slowly pour cornstarch mixture into tomato soup, stirring until incorporated.</li>
    <li>Pour half of the soup and basil leaves into a blender no more than half-full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree soup in batches until smooth. Return blended soup to pot and heat on low for 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon soup into serving bowls and top with Parmesan cheese and shredded basil.</li>
